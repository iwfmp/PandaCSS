 * Perfect center the body using positioning, and header/footer using flex.
 * That way if any part is missing it shouldn't spoil the rest,
 * and so we get a much bigger flexibility.
 *
 * 1. Perfect center the heros' object body.
 * 2. Simulate justify-contents' space-between but also when only footer
 *    is present make it appear at the bottom.
