/**
 * Components of modern web pages tend to have very localised heading styles.
 * Sometimes a h2 will be designed smaller than a h3 elsewhere.
 * Heading design should be agnostic to its semantic outline placement.
 * It makes much more sense to have them all inherit the same default size;
 * Thus allowing granular design with utility classes (E.g. .u-h1, .u-h2).
 *
 * 1. Make headings inherit the same size as the surrounding text by default.
 * 1. We don't necessarily want the font to be bolder, esp' when using custom fonts.
